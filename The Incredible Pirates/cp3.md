# Checkpoint 3: Hawkins Gay, Alex Leidner, Ramsey Wehbe <br />


## Theme:
   As members of the healthcare community our team would like to look into complaints and use of force in which injury was reported. Either alleged or sustained injury has the possibility to incite EMS or healthcare resource allocation for physical or mental treatment.  Interesting topics within this overarching theme include assessing differences in race, gender and neighborhood as it relates to injury prevalence.  This can be examined for officer injury as well as complainant; in particular, it would be interesting to explore these demographics and potentially elicit patterns of abuse that could prevent further injury. The severity and immediacy of EMS services could speak to restraint, or lack thereof, in the extreme, and even potentially to officer regret and responsibility in trying to immediately alleviate mistakes.
   
   As the course advances this topic would lend itself to traversing through the data parsing and visualization modules planned. While these are enumerated below, the ultimate task would be to try to parse through reports, using NLP, to add medical resource utilization to the known outcomes of TRR reports, either through parsing reports or inclusion of civil suits. This data, currently not included in attributes, would provide strong additional evidence to explore individual and societal impact.

##Running the code

Please open the D3 notebooks for the question of interest. The hyperlinks to these notebooks can be found in this Readme. The notebook code can be found in the Notebook folder in this directory. The csv files and json file required for this notebook creation can be found in the data folder in this directory.



## Questions
 1)	[Starburst graph showing nested racial groups, use of force encounters, type of use of force, injuries sustained versus alleged.](#Question-1)<br /> 
 2)	[Chloropleth map of Chicago that displays the use of force and attributes of the demographics in the force reports of the district as well as hospitals in that district.](#Question-2)
 
## Question-1
Exapdning treemap, circle packing, and starburst graph showing nested racial groups, use of force encounters, type of use of force, injuries sustained versus alleged. <br />

To use this graph simply click on the area of interest to see its components. If you hover your mouse, still, over a component the total number of force reports for this component will be displayed. You can zoom back out to the full picture by clicking outside of a selected area. <br />

As this information is expressed 3 different ways our group recommends looking at the Circle Packing Graph, as this graph allows representation of all minorities contained in this data. The small sample size mutes them when looking at the starburst map or the treemap. They however have been incldued as they give better representation of percent of the total cases than does the Circle Packing Graph.
