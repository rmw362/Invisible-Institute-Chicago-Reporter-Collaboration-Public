# Checkpoint 1: Hawkins Gay, Alex Leidner, Ramsey Wehbe


## Theme:
   As members of the healthcare community our team would like to look into complaints and use of force in which injury was reported. Either alleged or sustained injury has the possibility to incite EMS or healthcare resource allocation for physical or mental treatment.  Interesting topics within this overarching theme include assessing differences in race, gender and neighborhood as it relates to injury prevalence.  This can be examined for officer injury as well as complainant; in particular, it would be interesting to explore these demographics and potentially elicit patterns of abuse that could prevent further injury. The severity and immediacy of EMS services could speak to restraint, or lack thereof, in the extreme, and even potentially to officer regret and responsibility in trying to immediately alleviate mistakes.
   
   As the course advances this topic would lend itself to traversing through the data parsing and visualization modules planned. While these are enumerated below, the ultimate task would be to try to parse through reports, using NLP, to add medical resource utilization to the known outcomes of TRR reports, either through parsing reports or inclusion of civil suits. This data, currently not included in attributes, would provide strong additional evidence to explore individual and societal impact.

##Running the code
In order to run the code snippets below, you can either copy the code into a SQL interpreter or run the corresponding SQL question file in src.

## Questions
 1)	[What percentage of use of force incidents result in injury for citizens? Police officers? Broken down by race, age, neighborhood, 
 use of force (physical, taser, firearm, etc.), and other demographics?](##Question-1) 
 2)	[Are there differences in injury pattern in relation to different types of uses of force, i.e. taser vs. firearms vs. other, 
 stratified by race?](##Question-2)
 3)	[Are neighborhoods with higher rates of officer injury reports more likely to be associated with complaints and use of force fillings?](###Question-3) 
 4)	[Are individual officers more likely to be involved in use of force incidents that lead to injury?](##Question-4)
 5)	[Are individual officers more likely to underreport injuries - ie are they less likely to report injury in TRR when injury is alleged 
 by a complainant?](##Question-5)

## Question 3:
Are neighborhoods with higher rates of officer injury reports more likely to be associated with subject injuries or total number of events.  

-- This code will answer question 3 of checkpoint 1:
-- Please open question_3.sql and run the code: code as follows:
-- to view the tables in different orders, just replace order by with the appropriate column header
  
	SELECT beat, count(*) total_events,
		count(case when officer_injured = 'True' then 1 end) as officer_injured,
		count(case when officer_injured = 'True' then 1 end)*100/count(*) as percent_officer_injured,

## Question 4:
Are individual officers more likely to be involved with in use of force incidents that lead to injury?

-- This code will answer question 4 of checkpoint 1:
-- Please open question_4.sql : code as follows
  -- to view the tables in different orders, just replace order by with the appropriate column header

## Question 5: 
Are individual officers more likely to underreport injuries - ie are they less likely to report injury in TRR when injury is alleged 
by a complainant?
 
For question 5 code is found in the question_5.sql file.
First generate temporary tables by running Code from question_5.sql lines 0-52: Code as follows

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS force_allegation_counts;
	CREATE TEMP TABLE force_allegation_counts AS
		(SELECT da.officer_id,
		count(CASE WHEN dc.category = 'Use Of Force' THEN 1 END) AS total_use_of_force_complaints

	FROM trr_trr
	JOIN data_officer d on d.id = trr_trr.officer_id

	ORDER BY total_use_of_force_events DESC)
	;

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS complaint_percentages;
	CREATE TEMP TABLE  complaint_percentages AS
	(
		SELECT ot.officer_ID,

	);

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS alleged_injuries_not_counted;
	CREATE TEMP TABLE  alleged_injuries_not_counted AS
	(
	SELECT officer_ID, alleged_injuries,subject_injuries, percent_subject_alleged_injuries_not_counted
	FROM officer_trrs
	WHERE percent_subject_alleged_injuries_not_counted is NOT NULL and alleged_injuries >9
	order by percent_subject_alleged_injuries_not_counted DESC)
	;

Then to view complaint percentages table, table 5-1 as above please run codes from line 55 to 57

	SELECT *
	from complaint_percentages
	Limit 20;

To view the average numberof complaints referenced above run the code from line 60 to 61

	SELECT AVG(percent_complaint)
	FROM complaint_percentages;

To view table 5.2 “Alleged Injuries not counted” run the code from line 64 to 66

	SELECT *
	from alleged_injuries_not_counted
	limit 20;

To view the average of all officers percentage of alleged_injureis not counted run the code from line 69 to 70

	SELECT AVG(percent_subject_alleged_injuries_not_counted)
	FROM officer_trrs;

To view the average of officers percentage of alleged_injureis not counted who have 10 or more injuries alleged, run the code from line 73 to 74

	SELECT AVG(percent_subject_alleged_injuries_not_counted)
	FROM alleged_injuries_not_counted;
