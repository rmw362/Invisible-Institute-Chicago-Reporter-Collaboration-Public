## Theme:
   As members of the healthcare community our team would like to look into complaints and use of force in which injury was reported. Either alleged or sustained injury has the possibility to incite EMS or healthcare resource allocation for physical or mental treatment.  Interesting topics within this overarching theme include assessing differences in race, gender and neighborhood as it relates to injury prevalence.  This can be examined for officer injury as well as complainant; in particular, it would be interesting to explore these demographics and potentially elicit patterns of abuse that could prevent further injury. The severity and immediacy of EMS services could speak to restraint, or lack thereof, in the extreme, and even potentially to officer regret and responsibility in trying to immediately alleviate mistakes.
   
   As the course advances this topic would lend itself to traversing through the data parsing and visualization modules planned. While these are enumerated below, the ultimate task would be to try to parse through reports, using NLP, to add medical resource utilization to the known outcomes of TRR reports, either through parsing reports or inclusion of civil suits. This data, currently not included in attributes, would provide strong additional evidence to explore individual and societal impact.
