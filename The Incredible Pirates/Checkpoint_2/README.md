# Checkpoint 2: Hawkins Gay, Alex Leidner, Ramsey Wehbe <br />


## Theme:
   As members of the healthcare community our team would like to look into complaints and use of force in which injury was reported. Either alleged or sustained injury has the possibility to incite EMS or healthcare resource allocation for physical or mental treatment.  Interesting topics within this overarching theme include assessing differences in race, gender and neighborhood as it relates to injury prevalence.  This can be examined for officer injury as well as complainant; in particular, it would be interesting to explore these demographics and potentially elicit patterns of abuse that could prevent further injury. The severity and immediacy of EMS services could speak to restraint, or lack thereof, in the extreme, and even potentially to officer regret and responsibility in trying to immediately alleviate mistakes.
   
   As the course advances this topic would lend itself to traversing through the data parsing and visualization modules planned. While these are enumerated below, the ultimate task would be to try to parse through reports, using NLP, to add medical resource utilization to the known outcomes of TRR reports, either through parsing reports or inclusion of civil suits. This data, currently not included in attributes, would provide strong additional evidence to explore individual and societal impact.

##Running the code

This section of the code is to create Tableau visualizations. Created visualizations can be seen in the PDF or in the Tableau Workbook. <br />
These images were createad with psql 9.06.0201. <br />
Given connection issues to CPDB through tableau there are two versions of the workbook. <br />
.src\Checkpoint_2_Workbook_auto.twbx should contain 6/8 images and their table data offline, the final 2 images, Figure 2.1 and 2.2 you must log in with cpdb username and password to access. <br />
If this file does not allow for visualization please follow the steps ahead to insure that .src\Checkpoint_2_workbook.twb dependancies can be correctly linked. <br />

## Questions
 1)	[Use of force incidents by demographics (race, gender, age) and percentage that result in injury or lead to emergency medical attention](#Question-1) 
 2)	[Symbol/bubble map to assess geographic distribution for proportion of use of force incidents that result in injury.](#Question-2)
 
## Question-1
Use of force incidents by demographics (race, gender, age) and percentage that result in injury or lead to emergency medical attention <br />
For ease of use, csv files have been provided to link to Tableau. Please open .src\Checkpoint_2_Workbook.twb. After opening the workbook you must enter the correct password for cpdb-student. Please refer to the canvas for this password <br />
Please link the Race and Race % Sheet with .CP2\Race.csv <br />
Please link the Age and Age % Sheet with .CP2\Result_63.csv <br />
Please link the Gender and Gender % Sheet with .CP2\Result_64.csv <br />

These csv files were created using the cpdb database and the following SQL queries, which can be found in .src\checkpoint_2.sql. These can be runned and saved as csv files to 
recreate those tables, or the csv files have been provided as described above. <br />

Figure 2.1 and 2.2 were created by linking beats to districts using the following source:

Data for figure 2.1 and 2.2 <br />
Due to districts being combined on the map district 12 and 13 are combined.<br />
Districts 21 23 and 26-30 are not on the map and have not been included. <br />
