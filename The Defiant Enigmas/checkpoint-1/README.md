## Checkpoint 1
The following list the questions answered in this checkpoint and how to run the
code to return responses to those questions. For each question, if prompted for
a password, enter the one provided on the checkpoint 1 assignment page.

**Are allegations more likely to be sustained if they come from officers than from citizens, and if so, by how much?**
Using psql from the src folder, execute the following command:
```bash
psql -f Q1.sql -h cpdb.cgod7egsd6vr.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -U cpdb-student -d cpdb -p 5432
```
This should return something similar to the following:
```
 Percentage Officer Allegations Sustained | Percentage Citizen Allegations Sustained
------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------
                   0.42891566265060240964 |                   0.06698885927663933555
(1 row)
```

**How many police officers have more/less than X number of average allegations per year? For each officer, what is the primary precinct in which allegations were made?**
Using psql, execute the following command:
```bash
psql -f Q2.sql -h cpdb.cgod7egsd6vr.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -U cpdb-student -d cpdb -p 5432 -v compare_type="[ 'gt' | 'lt' ]" -v threshold="[integer]"
```
Here, values enclosed in [] are variables. For compare\_type, enter 'gt'
(greater than) or 'lt' (less than). For threshold, enter an integer value.
For example entering
```bash
psql.exe -f Q2.sql -h cpdb.cgod7egsd6vr.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -U cpdb-student -d cpdb -p 5432 -v compare_type="'gt'" -v threshold="6"
```
should return something similar to the following:
```
